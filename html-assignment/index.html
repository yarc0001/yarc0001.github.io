      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Mateo, a 28-year-old Colombian that recently moved to Canada. I
        studied International Business before and graduated in 2018. The
        business field allowed me to work in great places and meet amazing
        people; however, I was not particularly happy about the things I was
        doing, that’s when I decided to change my life and start from scratch in
        a new country. Canada has been the place to get to know me better and
        explore new passions. This journey has not been an easy one, the hardest
        part would be leaving my family and my cat Tila. However, I’m confident
        that once I am settled here, I’ll bring her with us. This decision was
        possible because I moved here with my partner, and it’s been an enormous
        support to have each other during this challenging process. I’m enjoying
        Canadian winter, but cannot wait to leave my house without 3 layers of
        clothes on.
