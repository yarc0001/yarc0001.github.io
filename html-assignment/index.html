        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am Mateo, a <em>28-year-old Colombian</em> that recently moved to
          Canada. I studied International Business before and graduated in
          August 28<sup>th</sup>,2018. The business field allowed me to work in
          great places and meet amazing people; however, I was not particularly
          happy about the things I was doing, that is when I decided to change
          my life and start from scratch in a new country. Canada has been the
          place to get to know me better and explore new passions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This journey has not been an easy one, the hardest part would have
          been leaving my family and my cat Tila. Nevertheless, I am confident
          that once I am settled here, I will bring our kitty daugther with us.
          This decision was possible because I moved here with my partner, it
          has been an enormous support to have each other during this
          challenging process; specially during winter. I am enjoying the
          experience of the Canadian winter, but cannot wait to leave my house
          without 3 layers of clothes on.
